# Self-Driving-Car-Term1-project2-Traffic-Sign-Classifier
The goal of this project is to classify the German traffic sign images with convolutional neural network (CNN) similar to LeNet
the original dataset trained with the defult LeNet5 architecture gets to about 90% accuracy. with tewaking the CNN parameter and expand the training dataset with modified images, i was able to get to 97~98% accuracy.
